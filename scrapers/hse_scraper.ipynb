       "0     As an employer, you must appoint a competent person or people to help you meet your health and safety legal duties. What a competent person does They should have the skills, knowledge and experience to be able to recognise hazards in your business and help you put sensible controls in place to protect workers and others from harm. Qualifications and training It's not usually essential for them to have formal qualifications and they're not required by law to have formal training, although it can help. Who you can appoint You could appoint (one or a combination of):  yourself one or more of your workers someone from outside your business  Usually, managing health and safety isn't complicated and you can do it yourself with the help of your workers. You know your workplace best and the risks associated with it. If there's a competent person within your workforce, use them rather than a competent person from outside your business. Using a consultant or adviser If your business or organisation doesn't have the competence to manage health and safety in-house, for example, if it's large, complex or high risk, you can get help from a consultant or adviser. But remember, as the employer, managing health and safety will still be your legal duty.

       "1     1. Overview The law says that every business must have a policy for managing health and safety. A health and safety policy sets out your general approach to health and safety. It explains how you, as an employer, will manage health and safety in your business. It should clearly say who does what, when and how. If you have five or more employees, you must write your policy down. If you have fewer than five employees you do not have to write anything down, but it is useful to do so. You must share the policy, and any changes to it, with your employees.

This duty is under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations, known as RIDDOR. Our RIDDOR pages explain what must be reported and how to make a report. Keep records If you have more than 10 employees, you must keep an accident book under social security law. You can buy one from HSE Books or record the details in your own record system. Keeping records of incidents helps you to identify patterns of accidents and injuries, so you can better assess and manage risk in your workplace. Records can also be helpful when you are dealing with your insurance company. Make sure you protect people's personal details by storing records confidentially in a secure place.
